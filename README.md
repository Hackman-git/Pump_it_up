# Pump_it_up
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all. Predict one of these three classes based on a number  of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
